Create a chat interface similar to Perplexity. The interface should allow a user to connect to various data sources. For this challenge, you can choose any 3 data sources from the list below and any 4 channels.
* 		Data Sources: GTM, Facebook Pixel, Google Ads Tag, Facebook Page, Website, Shopify, CRMs, Twitter Page, Review Sites, Ad Managers (Meta, Google, Tiktok, etc.).
* 		Channels: Email, SMS, Push, WhatsApp, Voice, Messenger, Ads.
Once connected, the system should simulate streaming a JSON output representing the "right time, right channel, right message, for the right audience". This JSON payload should be structured to be later transformed into an executable campaign for the selected channels.
Please host your solution in a public GitHub repository.
